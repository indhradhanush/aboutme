I am a Technology Professional in Networking and Security Technology. I focus on Web scripting, Networking and Security related interests. I have used my technology interests in weekend home projects.  

In parallel with my professional job, I am helping people kickstart their career by mentoring their experiences with first job. I also give trainings and workshops as part of my professional work. See more in my [Resume](/aboutme/resume/).

Given my experience, I also support:

- **Blog and articles** Regularly blogs about networking & security technologies, experiences, insights and tutorials at [Wordpress](https://whnetwork.wordpress.com/).
- **Colloborating coding projects** A few collaboration projects which can be shared are posted at here [GitHub](https://github.com/indhradhanush/).

If you need help in tech consulting, feel free to contact me!

In my spare time, I like to code, write about networking and security, and share it on my [blog](https://whnetwork.wordpress.com/) in easy to understand format even for a non-techie.

As a traveling professional, I relish exploring new destinations and immersing myself in diverse cultures and experiences. Traveling is one of my favorite pastimes, allowing me to broaden my horizons and learn from each unique journey. I indulge in comedy and action movies occasionally.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) with any questions or inquiries you may have.
