Hello! Iâ€™m Karthik, a passionate technology enthusiast with a deep curiosity for emerging technologies. I'm always eager to explore, learn, and leverage new advancements to benefit communities and organizations.

Recently, I joined Juniper Networks as a Senior Systems Engineer (Presales). Prior to this, I held key positions such as Senior Manager in Technical Marketing and Senior Systems Engineer at notable networking organizations like Extreme Networks, Brocade Communications, and Ruckus Networks. In these roles, I successfully secured customer orders and empowered numerous Systems Engineers globally to achieve the same.

In my current role, I specialize in systems engineering, utilizing my expertise in networking and security technologies for systems design. I also actively contribute to the tech community by sharing my knowledge through guest lectures and mentorship, helping others excel in their careers.

I publish my coding work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/indhradhanush/), maintain a [blog](https://whnetwork.wordpress.com/) where I document my experiences, insights, and tutorials.
